# Voice Recognition

The application supports voice commands to control the metronome. The following commands are recognized:

1. Start: Starts the metronome if it is not already playing.
2. Stop: Stops the metronome if it is currently playing.
3. [Number]: Sets the tempo to the specified number (between 10 and 400 BPM).


For example, saying "start" will start the metronome, and saying "120" will set the tempo to 120 BPM.

The voice recognition functionality is implemented using the Web Speech API.
